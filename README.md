# üêæ Wildlife Detection with YOLOv5

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)**, a real-time object detection model, to detect wildlife species in **camera trap images**.  
Such AI tools assist in **automated wildlife monitoring**, anti-poaching efforts, and habitat conservation.

## Key Features
- Detects animals in images.
- Uses pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
- Fast and accurate bounding box detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 repository

## Usage
1. Clone YOLOv5 repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
    cd yolov5
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Place camera trap images in `images/` folder.
3. Run `wildlife_detection.py` to detect animals.
4. Results will be saved with bounding boxes.

## Example Output

## Future Work
- Fine-tune YOLOv5 with custom wildlife datasets.
- Integrate with drone footage for real-time tracking.
- Build automated alerts for protected species sightings.
